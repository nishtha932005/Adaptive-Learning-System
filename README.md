The **Adaptive Learning Platform** is a dual-purpose educational system designed to bridge the gap between **Personalized Self-Paced Learning** and **Curriculum-Based Organizational Training**.

*   **For Independent Learners**: It uses **Generative AI (Gemini 1.5)** to create dynamic "Sagas" (courses) tailored to user "Vibes" (e.g., RPG-style, Academic, Bootcamp).
*   **For Organizations (Schools/Companies)**: It provides a rigid "Organizational Track" where Mentors manage rosters, assign mandatory content, and monitor risk via high-frequency analytics.

**Key Innovation**: The platform features a **Real-Time Deterministic Analytics Engine** that visualizes "Live Progress" by correlating global clickstream data with completed credit units, providing immediate feedback loops for students and predictive risk modeling for mentors.
